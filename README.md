# travelopia

1.Header and footer we set both height as 100px so, we kept main section's height as height: calc (100vh - 200px), if we change the height of the header or footer,Kindly update the ".main" CSS also to achieve full screen.

2.we used the main section's height in vh (Viewport Height) unit, to achieve responsiveness. note: we can use % also but vh is the correct way because % unit depends on parents size but vh unit depends on screen size.

3. Used media query for mobile and tab screens (786px- width).

4. Used cdn for using font awesome icons (6.4.2).

5. Small animation done in the title (Travelopia) and hover effects were in buttons on web menus.
