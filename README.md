# travelopia
1.Header and footer we set both height as 100px so, we kept main section's heigh as  height: calc(100vh - 200px), if we can changing height of header or footer, needs to change in .main css also to achive fullscreen and responsiveness,
2.we used main section's height's in vh (Viewport Height) unit, to achieve responsivnes. note: we can use % also but vh is is the correct way because % unit depends on parents size but vh unit depends on screen size.
3. Used media query for mobile and tab screens (786px- width) 
4. Used cdn for using fontawesome icons (6.4.2).
5. Small animation done in title (Travelopia) and hover effects were in button on web menus.
